# **CSC3224 Computer Game Development**

_Coursework 1 (1st March)_

_Game Prototyping_

_Semester 2 (25% of Module Mark)_

The overall aim of the projects within this module is to allow you to develop a video game of your choosing.

**Overview**

This first piece of coursework provides an opportunity for you to develop a prototype of your game. A prototype is not a full implementation of a game but should allow a player to:

1. Play a small or restricted element of a game
2. Understand the genre of a game
3. Realise the gameplay expectations
4. Achieve some limited goals within a game
5. Run the game from a web page (link must be provided)
6. Provide developer help (like cheats to allow greater testing)

A prototype **does not** have to:

1. Have finished graphics (sometimes shapes are substituted for moving objects)
2. Use the appropriate controllers (e.g., keyboard and mouse instead of gamepad)
3. Have any scoring or progress indication
4. Display any backstory or introductions

**What you need to do**

Develop a prototype game of your choosing (any genre) and make available for play. The recommended game development platform is [GDevelop](https://gdevelop-app.com/).

Export your [GDevelop](https://gdevelop-app.com/) game for web page hosting and host on github pages. This allows you to maintain the git repository of your GDevelop project (the development of your game) together with a web page on which to play your game.

[How to use GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a useful resource and explains the basic steps you need to take to host your game on a web page for free.

**Deliverables**

- The exported executable of your game and associated source code zipped and submitted to the coursework submission system
- A text file that contains a link to the github web page where the game can be played and a link to the github repository of your game

**Marking Scheme**

- 10 Marks available for game design:
  - 3 marks if interaction is possible (i.e., if the player can influence the environment in any way)
  - 3 marks if genre is clear (i.e., if it is clear what the player has to do after a little experimenting)
  - 2 marks for one or more goals (i.e., the player can achieve something - like collecting a coin or shooting something)
  - 2 marks for ease of play (i.e., the player can figure out what to do)
- 10 Marks available for technical design:
  - 3 marks for control management (i.e., player can control environment as expected - like making a character run or making a gun fire)
  - 3 marks for event handling (i.e., environment reacts to a player&#39;s interaction in an expected way - like a bullet comes out of a gun or a character falls off a ledge)
  - 4 marks for environment automation (i.e., the game starts and plays even if the player doesn&#39;t do anything - like when aliens appear and attack or a timer counts down)
- 5 Marks for developer tools:
  - 5 Marks for anything that may help the developer test the game (i.e., cheat keys to jump through a level, invulnerability on or off)

**Learning Outcomes**

- Identify different design issues related to computer games development
- Identify the mathematics associated with different aspects of computer games and utilise such knowledge in the development of computer games
- Discuss appropriate enabling technologies for computer games development
- Intended Skill Outcomes
- Exhibit skills appropriate for the development of a computer game via various enabling Implement the appropriate techniques used by developers during the production, deployment and maintenance of computer games
